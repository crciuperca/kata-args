#Kata: Args
#From The Coding Dojo Handbook
#App that correctly identifies args:
-l = logs           | can be true if it is present | false if not present
-p = port           | has an integer value         | 0 if not present
-d = directory      | has a string value           | "" if not present
-g = string list    | ["a", "b", "c"]              | [] if not present
-i = integer list   | [1, 2, 3]                    | [] if not present
